				homoeopathy?<img src="imgs/down.svg" /> </a>
			<p class="body">Homoeopathy is a holistic way of healing an

			<a href="#" class="header"><img src="imgs/down.svg" /> What are
				homoeopathic medicines?</a>
			<p class="body">Homoeopathic medicines have been used by
				generations of physicians for more than 200 years. As of today
				millions of patients around the world rely on these medicines to
				help them recover acute or chronic diseases. These medicines contain
				active ingredients those derived from highly diluted plants,
				minerals or animals. In India, homoeopathic medicines are
				manufactured under strict accordance with the HPI, Homoeopathic
				Pharmacopoeia of India and GMP, Good Manufacturing Practices. They

		<div class="accordion">
			<a href="#" class="header"><img src="imgs/down.svg" /> How does
				homoeopathic medicine work?</a>
			<p class="body">Homoeopathy, as a science of medicine is a
				stimulation therapy, which supports natural regenerative healing
				power of an organism, by enhancing body's 'Vital Force' or
				'Auto-regulatory Power'. Meaning, the science of medicine
				intelligently act in the same way as our system's defense reactions.
				They stimulate the natural defences of the body in order to make
				them more effective and thus, work with the body rather than against
				it. This is the reason why, in homoeopathy, only infinitesimal doses
				are needed. It was after years of experimenting that Samuel
				Hahnemann, founder of the homeopathic method, came to the following
				conclusion: "In order to bring about prompt, gentle, and lasting
				improvement, you most often need to use infinitesimal doses."</p>
			<p class="body bold" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Homoeopathy
				Works on Three Premises:</p>
			<p class="body"
				style="background-color: #ED7D31; color: white; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Any
				biologically active substance can cause a set of symptoms to appear
				in a healthy person. These symptopms are "characteristics of the
				substance" used.</p>
			<p class="body"
				style="background-color: #A5A5A5; color: white; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Anyone
				suffering from a particular disease shows a set of symptoms which is
				"characteristic of the disease". These pathological symptoms can be
				defined as being "changes in the way the person feels or behaves."</p>
			<p class="body"
				style="background-color: #FFC000; color: black; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">The
				cure is comfirmed by the objective disappearance of pathological
				symptomps, may be obtained by taking the substance who experimental
				symptoms in healthy persons are most similat to the patient's own
				symptoms, provided this substance has ben prepared homoeopathically.</p>

		<div class="accordion">
			<a href="#" class="header"><img src="imgs/down.svg" /> Homoeopathy
				Vs Homeopathy?</a>
			<p class="body">Hahnemann, the founder of Homoeopathy was also a
				linguist and he thoughtfully chose the name of our new system of
				medicine. The word Homoeopathy, comes from the Greek "homeois"
				meaning similar or like. The word is united with "pathos", meaning
				suffering, and bringing them together means "similar suffering". In
				Latin language the word "homo" means "man" and the word "path" is
				"the way". So, the word Homoeopathy may contain energies, which
				correctly represents our science of new medicine.</p>
			<p class="body">The word first appeared in Hahnemann's essay,
				"Indications of the Homoeopathic Employment in Medicine in Ordinary
				Practice". Hahnemann himself was quite sensitive about the spelling
				and he said in a Note Bene in the second volume of Materia Medica
				Pura and in Lesser Writings that, "the omission of the dipthong [œ]
				makes the root of the word mean not similar". "Are they all
				labouring under the same malady or stupidity"? "Should not anyone
				who ventures to step forward as a critic of the 'spirit of the
				homoeopathic doctrine' have to begin with at least some idea of the
				meaning of the word Homoeopathy." So in good spirits of Hahnemann's
				ideology and Homoeopathy as a science of medicine, 20 years from
				now, Dr. Raj Homoeo Pharmacy decided to have dipthong [œ] in its
				name respecting the meaning in the name of our science of medicine.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="accordion">
			<a href="#" class="header"><img src="imgs/down.svg" /> Are your
				products safe to take while pregnant?</a>
			<p class="body">All over-the-counter products must carry warnings
				for pregnant or nursing mothers as required. Dr. Raj Homoeo
				Pharmacy's products claim warnings on the labels. Please read the
				label claim carefully. We still advise working with your health care
				practitioner.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="accordion">
			<a href="#" class="header"><img src="imgs/down.svg" /> Where can I
				find clinical trials?</a>
			<p class="body">Each homoeopathic ingredient is based on
				sophisticated and exhaustive clinical trials called "proving," which
				are scientific research procedures that have been conducted for more
				than 200 years. Homeopathic physicians were the first doctors to
				ever conduct double-blind, placebo-controlled experiments, and they
				established the first medical association in the United States. At
				the turn of the twentieth century, there were 22 homeopathic medical
				schools and 100 homeopathic hospitals in the U.S. treating thousands
				of patients. There are still many homeopathic hospitals in Europe,
				and homeopathic medicine is now covered by the Swiss national health
				plan. This ruling happened in 2006 after the Swiss government
				conducted an extensive, multi-year study, which concluded that
				homeopathic medicine is extremely cost-effective and safe.</p>
			<p class="body">The FDA recognizes the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia
				of the United States (HPUS**), which includes the list of about
				1,300 ingredients allowable for use. Hundreds of modern homeopathic
				research studies and clinical trials exist.</p>

				its needs and weight and get the dosage it needs.</p>

				products contain animal ingredients?</a>
