		<h3 class="fgmain medium-title">Meet The Founder</h3>
		<p class="paragraph">The journey with a vision "to serve" the
			community began 30 years ago, by Dr. RajLakshmi Joshi, when she
			started practicing as a homoeopath in Ahmedabad Gujarat, India. Even
			today, she provides her honorary services at no cost to a charitable
			trust Shree Vallabh Sadan Haveli - Vaishnav Temple in Ahmedabad,
			Gujarat. At the trust, she has been practicing homoeopathy since 25
			years, which benefits the underprivileged with low cost homoeopathic
			medicines. Her persistent hard work and significant services to the
			community paid off in 10 years when she got recognized as one of the
			leading woman homoeopath in the metropolitan city.</p>
		<p class="paragraph marginB30">She earned the recognition with her
			power to heal patients especially those suffering from primary
			sterility, secondary sterility, extreme depression, as well as
			autism. Dr. RajLakshmi believes in treating an individual as a
			'Whole' (mind, body, and spirit), not just the disease. She shared
			similar vision with her husband Mr. Chandramauli Joshi and together
			in the year 1995, they founded today's one of the leading
			homoeopathic manufacturing companies in India, Dr. RAJ Homoeo
			Pharmacy. Founders' vision "to serve", is still one of the core
			values of Dr. RAJ. And, we still follow the belief of Dr. RajLakshmi
			that "a treatment includes empowering a person as a 'whole', and not
			just curing the disease".</p>
