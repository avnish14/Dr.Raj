		<h3 class="fgmain marginB10 medium-title">Tablet Section</h3>
		<h3 class="marginB10">Overview</h3>
		<p class="paragraph marginB30"">The manufacture of
			oral solid dosage forms such as tablets is a complex multi-stage
			process under which the starting materials change their physical
			characteristics a number of times before the final dosage form is
			produced. In the tablet-pressing process, all ingredients taken are
			dry, powdered and of uniform grain size as much as possible. It is
			ensured that the appropriate amount of active ingredient is equal in
			each tablet so ingredients are well-mixed.
		<p>
		<h3>Trituration</h3>
		<p class="paragraph marginB30">Trituration is mostly 1x potency tablets. Dr.
			Raj competes with top brands in this area of expertise. We have
			expertise in the manufacturing processes and good knowhow on quality
			of the product. Dr. Raj follows the process to manufacture 1X single
			remedy medicines as written in Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia of India,
			HPI</p>
		<h3 class="marginB10">Quality Control</h3>
		<p class="paragraph">The qualities of all the raw materials are
			ascertained and standardized referring Homoeopathic pharmacopeia of
			India. Dr. Raj follows the Quality Control processes as per written
			in Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia of India, HPI.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">Tablets are constantly subjected to. Such
			stress in the tablets can lead to issues such as capping, aberration,
			or even breakage. So, it is therefore important that the tablet is
			formulated to also withstand such stresses.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">As a part of Quality Control, below are the
			Physical tests those are performed for each batch during
			manufacturing:</p>
		<p class="paragraph">Hardness, Tablet Diameter & Thickness,
			Disintegration, Weight Variation, Friability</p>
		<p class="paragraph">As a part of Quality Control, below are the
			Chemical tests that are taken</p>
		<p class="paragraph marginB30">
			Content Uniformity, Assay, Shelf Life
		</p>
		<h3 class="marginB10">Process Control</h3>
		<p class="paragraph">Physical Uniformity Test : This test is
			performed to check the Physical uniformity of a final product by a
			Process Control data collection, at every 30 minutes. The data is
			collected and checked at every 30 minutes of tablet compression
			process. The list of tests performed are Weight variation test,
			Disintegration-time, Friability, and Hardness.</p>
		<p class="paragraph marginB30">We also have line integration, inspections
			and troubleshooting. We have a complete Quality Management System
			which involves collecting documentary evidence of all aspects of
			compliance like maintain SOP, critical control points are required in
			packaging methodology which has been proven useful. Our promise of
			quality assurance also extends beyond the packaging operations
			through distribution.</p>

		<p class="paragraph marginB30">Uniformity, cleanliness, sterility, and other
			requirements are needed to maintain Good Manufacturing Practices. We
			also have line integration, inspections and troubleshooting. We have
			a complete Quality Management System which involves collecting
			documentary evidence of all aspects of compliance like maintain SOP,
			critical control points are required in packaging methodology which
			has been proven useful. Our promise of quality assurance also extends
			beyond the packaging operations through distribution.</p>
		<h3 class="fgmain marginB10 medium-title">Oral Liquids Section</h3>
		<h3 class="marginB10">Overview</h3>
		<p class="paragraph">A concentrated aqueous preparation of highest
			pharmaceutical grade glucose with flavouring agents and medicinal
			substances is manufactured under different medicinal combination. In
			medicinal syrups, saturated solutions of sugar are mixed with
			demineralised water in which medicinal substances or drugs are
			dissolved. The fluid extract known as Dilution and Mother Tincture of
			the respective medicines is mixed with the syrup.</p>
		<p class="paragraph marginB30">For drops, demineralised water with the fluid
			extracts as medicines are dissolved. The fluid extracts are called
			Dilutions and Mother Tinctures. If the drugs prepared require solid
			medicines, then first they are prepared in the tablet section to
			attain appropriate potency, thereby used in the manufacturing.</p>
		<h3 class="marginB10">Quality Control</h3>
		<p class="paragraph">Dr. Raj assures that all our manufacturing
			steps follow very stringent quality control procedures under cGMP
			process guideline starting from incoming inspection until shipping.
			The accuracy of all weighing balances is maintained by tests such as
			Calibration Test and Reproducibility Test. The water is purified and
			filtered at the plant while the Quality control technicians ensure to
			destroy any microbial or fungal growth in the water. We test the
			water TDS frequently to ensure its usability.</p>
		<p class="paragraph">As a part of Quality Control, below are the
			Physical tests those are performed for each batch during
			manufacturing</p>
		<p class="paragraph">TDS Measurement & Conductivity, Color, Odor,
			And Taste, Visual Inspection, Clarity Testing</p>
		<p class="paragraph">As a part of Quality Control, below are the
			Chemical tests that are taken</p>
		<p class="paragraph marginB30">Assay Of Active Indegrients, PH Measurement,
			Density Check, Drug Content Uniformity, Shelf Life</p>
		<h3 class="marginB10">Process Control</h3>
		<p class="paragraph">Dr. Raj manufactures consistent quality
			product at all times. To achieve appropriate process control, all
			process steps are carefully reduced to writing after being shown to
			be effective. These processes are standard operating procedures
			(SOPs), where no extemporaneous changes are permitted to be made in
			these procedures; any change must go through the same approval steps
			as the original written SOP.</p>
		<p class="paragraph marginB30">All external records are kept to give
			assurance at the end of the production process that all steps have
			been performed as prescribed. Such in-process control is essential to
			assuring the quality of the product, since these assurances are even
			more significant than those from product release testing.</p>

			Application Section</h3>
		<p class="paragraph marginB30">Our external application section consists of
			Oil Section in particular. At Dr. Raj, we have put all our research
			and development expertise in our external application segment. In the
			manufacturing, process vessels, storage tanks, filling and packaging
			machines are used. Dr. Raj performs specified tests and controls to
			maintain the products quality and efficacy until it's expiry.</p>
