				<p class="paragraph">The journey with a vision "to serve" the
					community began 30 years ago, by Dr. RajLakshmi Joshi, when she
					started practicing as a homoeopath in Ahmedabad Gujarat, India.
					Even today, she provides her honorary services at no cost to a
					charitable trust Shree Vallabh Sadan Haveli - Vaishnav Temple in
					Ahmedabad, Gujarat. At the trust, she has been practicing
					homoeopathy since 25 years, which benefits the underprivileged with
					low cost homoeopathic medicines. Her persistent hard work and
					significant services to the community paid off in 10 years when she
					got recognized as one of the leading woman homoeopath in the
					metropolitan city.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">She earned the recognition with her power
					to heal patients especially those suffering from primary sterility,
					secondary sterility, extreme depression, as well as autism. Dr.
					RajLakshmi believes in treating an individual as a 'Whole' (mind,
					body, and spirit), not just the disease. She shared similar vision
					with her husband Mr. Chandramauli Joshi and together in the year
					1995, they founded today's one of the leading homoeopathic
					manufacturing companies in India, Dr. RAJ Homoeo Pharmacy.
					Founders' vision "to serve", is still one of the core values of Dr.
					RAJ. And, we still follow the belief of Dr. RajLakshmi that "a
					treatment includes empowering a person as a 'whole', and not just
					curing the disease".</p>
